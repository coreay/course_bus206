**Unit 3: Hardware and Software of Information Systems** <span
id="3"></span> 
*As mentioned in the course introduction, much of IS is now centered on
technology.  Accordingly, IS capabilities are mostly limited to the
hardware and software capabilities of a given system.  Ten years ago,
the average Internet user could download an MP3 music file in a few
minutes over a cable.  This can now be done in seconds wirelessly from
just about anywhere in the developed world thanks to improvements in
hardware and software.  While it is nearly impossible to remain in front
of technology developments, it is possible to analyze trends in
technology advancements and identify what hardware and software may give
you a competitive advantage.*  
  
 *This unit will first discuss the hardware component of technology,
followed by software.  The unit finishes with a discussion of networking
as a component of technology. *

**Unit 3 Time Advisory**  
This unit should take you approximately 18 hours to complete.  
  
 ☐    Subunit 3.1: 6 hours  
  
 ☐    Subunit 3.2: 6 hours  
  
 ☐    Subunit 3.3: 6 hours

**Unit3 Learning Outcomes**  
Upon successful completion of this unit, students will be able to:  
-   Compare and contrast hardware and software.
-   Identify the types of networks and their general functions.
-   Describe the importance of the Internet to information systems.
-   Explain how a lack of computer security places an organization in
    peril.
