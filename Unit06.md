**Unit 6: Security Failures and the Future of MIS** <span
id="6"></span> 

*Even though most businesses use similar software to manage information,
the information itself is usually kept secret and considered vital to
the success of the firm.  Security is particularly important in a
“flattening world,” where information now travels internationally.  A
manager working from home in Florida talks to a programmer in India who,
in turn, sends data to another manager working in an office in Berlin.
 Preventing competitors from seeing or stealing this information has
become important to business success. *  
  

*Of course, as information systems become increasingly sophisticated and
complicated, without the proper precautions the chances of a failure
increase.  Data center backups, emergency power, and software failures
can all cripple or close an ill-prepared business.*  
  

*This unit concludes with a look at the future of MIS.  After studying
the security issues and failures of various systems, the outlook can
seem bleak. Wherever there is a problem in MIS, there are new dot com
and/or employment/career opportunities to find profitable solutions.*

    driving slowly past the building you are working that reminds you of
    a surveillance van.  You have seen this vehicle several times. 
    Based on the article you read, make a list of possible actions you
    might take to protect the sensitive data you are accessing at the
    time you spot the suspicious vehicle.  Why did you choose these
    actions rather than just ignore the van?
