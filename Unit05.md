**Unit 5: Strategic Management Information Systems** <span
id="5"></span> 
*Strategic MIS is the application of information management in the
overall strategy of a business.  Many corporations include a Chief
Information Officer (CIO) in senior management to ensure that corporate
strategies can be effectively implemented to be more competitive.  What
good would it do for Apple to create an iPhone application that can tell
where you are and serve you ads based on location if it isn’t
technically feasible?  Part of the role of the CIO would be to figure
out if it is possible to do this now—and if not now, when.*  
  
 *This unit will examine how information technology and systems are
changing the way organizations operate.  The unit starts with an
examination of some of the key technological forces that characterize
the information age that all firms must consider in their strategic
planning.  Next, the special characteristics and challenges faced by
“business-to-business” operations are described.  The unit concludes
with an examination of the impact of information technology on
organizations and the means by which they are adapting to changes in
technology.*
