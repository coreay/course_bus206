**Unit 1: Introduction to Management Information Systems** <span
id="1"></span> 
*Information systems are designed to collect data and turn it into
information. * *These systems process information by gathering and
organizing data so it can be distributed in an understandable format. 
Information systems processing includes data retrieval, data storage,
and the execution of transactions utilizing data.  If you were given a
list of home prices in various zip codes and needed to report on which
regions were experiencing price increases and decreases, how would you
do it?  Without having information about past prices (e.g., dates of
sale) or the homes themselves (e.g., square footage), this would be a
difficult task.  However, if the data had been entered into a database
with all of this information, it could be called upon quickly, and you
would have your report ready in seconds.  In the past, such a report on
home prices could take days to compile.  Thanks to modern information
systems, it can take a few minutes.*  
  
 *Much of MIS is driven by innovation.  The right technology, processes,
people, and structures come together to solve problems utilizing new
techniques and strategies.  In this unit, we will look at the
applications of MIS in business and learn how far MIS has come since the
inception of the information age.*
