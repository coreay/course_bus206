**Unit 2: Information Systems Development** <span id="2"></span> 
*Businesses have diverse needs.  While software packages for managing
information exist, most software is not “plug and play” ready for most
business applications.  IT departments, in conjunction with
representatives from all lines of business, must work together to
develop and implement information system solutions.  The IS development
process can range from the simple to the extremely complicated. 
Managers often find themselves disagreeing about which information is
most important and what is worth developing.  The tradeoffs between
financial resources, time, and the capabilities of current information
systems can lead to frustration; for this reason, IS development is a
very important function within a business.*  
  
 *This unit begins by describing the elements of the IS development
process, which includes requirements, architecture, design, coding,
testing, and maintenance.  Next, some of the main issues inherent in IS
development will be explored, such as cost, speed, complexity, and user
adoption.  The unit ends with a discussion of other IS development
methodologies such as iterative, big bang, and prototyping.*

**Unit 2 Time Advisory**  
This unit should take you approximately 16 hours to complete.  
  
 ☐    Subunit 2.1: 4 hours  
  
 ☐    Subunit 2.2: 6 hours  
  
 ☐    Subunit 2.3: 6 hours

**Unit2 Learning Outcomes**  
Upon successful completion of this unit, students will be able to:  
-   Identify the processes associated with designing an information
    system.
-   Compare and contrast best practices of each of the IS development
    methodologies: iterative, big bang, and prototyping.
-   Define the Systems Development Life Cycle and list the steps
    involved.
-   Describe some of the key issues involved in IS development and their
    impact on business.

     Instructions: Please click on the link above and read the chapter
    (pages 22-28) up to the “History” section for an overview of the
    life cycle of the IS development process and a better understanding
    of why business-application development projects have failed when
    not following the System Development Life Cycle (SDLC) process. 
    While different resources will list the steps of the SDLC with a
    variety of terms, center your quest for knowledge on the analysis,
    conceptual design, design, implementation, testing, installation,
    and maintenance phases.  When you have finished, watch the next
    video below to see how everyone has their own vision for the
    completed system and why you need the SDLC process to capture and
    manage a business-application development project.
