**Unit 4: Data Management** <span id="4"></span> 
*Data is a collection of facts.  For example, the population estimates
for China and the United States are “data.”  Information is the
presentation of these facts in an organized manner, that is, the
presentation of these population counts side-by-side with other facts
like per-capita income.  Knowledge refers to the use of information to
make informed decisions—in this case, policy decisions about China and
the United States.  Managing data allows the government, corporations,
and even individuals to apply this knowledge to their everyday lives. 
Managing data can be difficult because databases are often filled with
more information than you need.  In this unit, you will explore the
challenges of data management and learn how to take data and turn it
into knowledge.*  
  
 *We have used the word “database”* *a number of times in this course. 
We will now define and study databases in detail.  Entire courses are
devoted to this subject, as the uses and types of databases are as
varied as the number of businesses that need them.  However, you can
expect to leave this section with enough of an understanding of
databases to have a conversation with any database administrator about
the needs of your team or department.  This course focuses on relational
databases.*
